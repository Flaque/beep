# Boop

This is a programming language experiment. Take everything with a grain of salt, nothing's working right now and I have no plans at this time to support this language.

## Overview

Boop is a sane scripting language for... scripting.

It's main claim to fame is every command in your $PATH is a function in Boop by default.

In other words, all standard unix commands like `cd`, `grep`, `ls` all work by default. All commands you've `brew install`'d or `apt-get`'d work too.

See [langspec](langspec.md) for more info.
